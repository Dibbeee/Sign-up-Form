# The Odin Project

# Sign-up-Form

I have just finished the initial project of the Sign-up form for the intermediate html and css Course.
<br>
I took some time to get going becasue it didnt seem so fun at first, but when I eventually started with the project I found that it was a bit of a brain teaser since I had not really made a real sign-up form before this project...
<br>
The trickiest thing for me about this project was first to visualise how the structure of the sign-up form and layout was going to be constructed and then trying back and forth between different styles and such but eventually I settled on the structure of the sign-up form and after that it was pretty easy to implement the rest of the stuff...
<br>
I had some issues with getting the passwords to match with JS and I am still not exacly sure why it didn't work at first and I looked all over the internet to see if I did something wrong but I could not find anything about it that solved it for me... So I ended up writing it in another way and when I did that it worked flawlessly and I was pretty much done with the project...
<br>
I looked into the JavaScript course that I will be doing later and found that there is more about forms there so I hope that I will come back to this project and see how I can implement more stuff but also see how it can be better implemented or if something is missing or whatever...
